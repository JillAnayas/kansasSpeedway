Website re-design 2014

Redesign for Enterprise CMS 
Re-creating functionality and styles.
Note: The track is responsible for their content and images, and keeping their content with in the boundries of the edges.
We can't have set widths with overflow: hidden; So you may notice some issues with the tracks writing unnecessary large titles.
